# 💸 Fintech-NLP-Transformers

Transformer-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, specifically fine-tuned for **financial text sentiment analysis**. This repository provides the infrastructure for preprocessing, training, and inference on financial news, tweets, or reports using state-of-the-art transformer models (like BERT, RoBERTa).

---

## 🚀 Overview

In financial markets, understanding sentiment from unstructured data (news headlines, earnings reports, tweets) is crucial for building predictive models or monitoring investor mood. This repo is designed to:

- Fine-tune transformer models on domain-specific (financial) sentiment datasets.
- Provide tools for tokenization, dataset preprocessing, training, and inference.
- Allow easy experimentation and deployment of sentiment classifiers.
