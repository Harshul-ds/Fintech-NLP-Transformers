[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

State-of-the-art transformer models fine-tuned for financial sentiment analysis on news, tweets, and reports. Built for quantitative researchers, fintech developers, and trading analysts.

## 🔍 Overview
In financial markets, extracting sentiment from unstructured text is critical for:
- Building predictive trading models
- Monitoring real-time investor sentiment
- Analyzing earnings reports and news impact
- Generating alternative data signals

This repository provides a production-ready pipeline for:
1. **Domain-specific fine-tuning** of transformer models
2. Financial text preprocessing and tokenization
3. Training/evaluation workflows
4. Model deployment for inference

## ✨ Key Features
- **Financial-optimized tokenization** (handles tickers, currencies, financial terms)
- **Preprocessing pipelines** for news/twitter/earnings reports
- **Quantitative evaluation metrics** (accuracy, F1, custom trading performance tests)
- **Distillation support** for production deployment
- **Customizable classification heads** (binary/multi-class sentiment)
